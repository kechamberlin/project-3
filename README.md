# project-3

This is a single-page React webpage.

I remade my girlfriend's father's legal website.  

The design was to have the page jump down to the appropriate section when a Nav link was pressed. This feature was not included in the final project, but I will work on it after the program ends.

The Associate Attorneys section uses MongoDB.
